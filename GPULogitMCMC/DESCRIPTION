Description: Performs a random walk Methropolis-Hastings algorithm on the posterior distribution of the parameters of a logistic regression model. 
	Uses spherical diagonal normal distributed proposals. The computations of the matrix multiplications and logistic function are parallelised.
	One implementation uses manual matrix multiplications, another uses the cuBLAS library. Wrappers are also provided to compute the 
	log-likelihood functions separately.
